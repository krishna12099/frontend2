        The literal meaning of ‘Comprehension’ is understanding. It shows how well you have understood a paragraph that you have read or how correctly you have grasped its meaning. To test it, a set of questions is given after a paragraph relating to the subject matter. The answers are contained in the passage. It only requires a bit of intelligence to identify the sentence or sentences that form the answer to a particular question.  Write them down in your own hand. It is simple. The exercise of comprehension is meant to assess and better the ability of a student to read and comprehend what he reads. Sometimes the answers need to be written in the student’s own words, although not very different from the given text, only a little adjustment to have the sentence grammatically and meaning-wise correct. Hence, a student must be able to express his thoughts precisely with incorrect words.
