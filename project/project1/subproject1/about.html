                    <p>Taking good care of yourself is no longer just an accompaniment of cosmetic surgery or of being in the glamour industry. At The Esthetic Clinics™, we believe that everyone has the right to demand the best & so every diagnosis, every procedure, incision & surgery performed has to be right for the person involved. Gone are the days when a ‘botched up’ plastic surgery could be ascribed to it being just a ‘reconstructive’ procedure & the patient left with ugly scars to deal with, for life. Unfortunately, cosmetic care is also becoming increasingly associated with and undermined by skin & spa ‘salons’ & practitioners with dubious credentials. At The Esthetic Clinics ™ every procedure is esthetically planned & performed to give the most pleasing results. We believe no procedure is minor & that our clients desire and deserve the best results, irrespective of whether it is orbital surgery or facial plastic surgery for cancer, facial plastic surgery for facial scars & post facial fractures, cosmetic rhinoplasty, laser procedures for skin care or face lift & Botox & filler injections for removing facial wrinkles. Thus, every procedure is an aesthetic one, every patient an aesthetic one, irrespective of the underlying pathology.

                        Medicine is becoming more and more specialized & you will be reassured to know that our physicians deal only with the areas of their super-specialty – Areas in which they have trained & practiced for many years!
